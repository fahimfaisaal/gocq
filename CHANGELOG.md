# Changelog

## [v3.0.0] (2025-05-01)

### üîÑ Project Evolution: GoCQ ‚Üí VarMQ

- **Project Rebranding**: Renamed from GoCQ to VarMQ
- **Organization Move**: Moved from personal repository `github.com/fahimfaisaal/gocq` to organization `github.com/goptics/varmq`
- **Architectural Redesign**: Shifted from a simple concurrent queue to a full message queue system with adaptable backends

### ‚ú® Expanded Capabilities

- **Advanced Queue Variants**:
  - Added Persistent Queue support for data durability across restarts
  - Added Distributed Queue support for scaling across multiple systems
  - Maintained Priority Queue functionality with improvements
- **Worker Abstraction Layer**:
  - Introduced explicit worker types and interfaces (`NewWorker`, `NewErrWorker`, `NewVoidWorker`)
  - Added support for different worker patterns (result-returning, error-only, void)
  - Simplified worker creation with dedicated factory methods

### üîß API Improvements

- **Worker-Centric Design**:

  - New approach: Create worker first, then bind to desired queue type
  - Old: `queue := NewQueue(concurrency, workerFunc)`
  - New: `worker := NewWorker(workerFunc)` followed by `queue := worker.BindQueue()`

- **Enhanced Job Control**:

  - Replaced simple channel returns with comprehensive Job interface
  - Added job status tracking, explicit result methods, and error handling
  - New job management methods like `Status()`, `IsClosed()`, `Result()`, and `Drain()`

- **Batch Processing**:
  - Improved batch job handling with dedicated group job interfaces
  - Enhanced result collection mechanisms for batch operations

### üöÄ Production Readiness

- **Extensibility**:
  - Added adapter interfaces for creating custom queue backends
  - Support for external storage systems like Redis (via optional adapters)
- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive API reference with detailed examples
  - Visual architecture diagrams and sequence flows
  - Clearer usage patterns and best practices

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

- **Performance Optimizations**:

  - Reduced goroutine overhead in batch operations
  - Improved memory efficiency and resource management
  - Enhanced concurrency control mechanisms

- **Type Safety**:
  - Strengthened generic constraints
  - Better error and panic propagation and handling

## [v2.0.0] (2025-03-14)

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

- Complete API redesign for better type safety and error handling
- Replaced channel-based result handling with Job interface
- Introduced new Job types for better control and status tracking
- Separated void (non-returning) queues into dedicated implementations

### ‚ú® New Features

- Added `EnqueuedJob` interface for handling individual job results
- Added `EnqueuedGroupJob` interface for handling batch job results
- Introduced void queue variants for operations without return values
- Added job status tracking (`Status()` method)
- Added `IsClosed()` method to check job state
- Added `Drain()` method for discarding results
- Enhanced error handling with dedicated error channels
- Added `Result()` and `WaitForError()` method for synchronous result retrieval
- Added `Errors()` method for retrieving errors from void group jobs
- Added `Results()` method for retrieving results from group jobs
- Added `Close()` method for closing jobs and associated channels

### üîß API Changes

#### Queue Creation

- Old: `NewQueue[T, R](concurrency uint, worker func(T) R)`
- New: `NewQueue[T, R](concurrency uint32, worker WorkerFunc[T, R])`

#### Job Submission

- Old: `Add(data T) <-chan R`
- New: `Add(data T) EnqueuedJob[R]`

#### Batch Operations

- Old: `AddAll(data ...T) <-chan R`
- New: `AddAll(data []T) EnqueuedGroupJob[R]`

#### Priority Queue

- Old: `Add(data T, priority int) <-chan R`
- New: `Add(data T, priority int) EnqueuedJob[R]`
- Old: `AddAll(items []PQItem[T]) <-chan R`
- New: `AddAll(items []PQItem[T]) EnqueuedGroupJob[R]`

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- Optimized memory usage with better channel management
- Reduced goroutine overhead
- Improved priority queue operations
- Reduced spawning of n number of goroutines to constant inside `AddAll` method

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

- Enhanced type safety with generic constraints
- Better resource cleanup mechanisms
- Improved concurrency control
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Thread-safe operations guaranteed

### üìö Documentation

- Updated API reference with new interfaces and methods
- Added more code examples
- Improved documentation clarity
- Added performance benchmarks

### üîß Other Changes

- Minimum Go version requirement updated to 1.24+
- Internal refactoring for better maintainability
- Enhanced test coverage
- Added benchmarks for normal and void queue operations

## [v1.0.0] (2025-03-7)

### üéâ Initial Release

VarMQ (Go Concurrent Queue) is a high-performance concurrent queue system for Go, featuring both FIFO and priority queue implementations.

### ‚ú® Features

- Generic type support for both data and results
- Configurable worker pool with controlled concurrency
- Two queue implementations:
  - Standard FIFO Queue with O(1) operations
  - Priority Queue with O(log n) operations
- Non-blocking job submission
- Thread-safe operations
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Clean shutdown mechanisms
- Comprehensive test coverage

### üîß Technical Details

- Minimum Go version: 1.24+
- Standard Queue: Based on `container/list`
- Priority Queue: Based on `container/heap`
- Thread safety using sync primitives
- Memory-efficient channel management
